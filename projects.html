		<h2>Projects</h2>
		<p>Here are some links to my favorite projects I have uploaded to Github.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/jackie-mcaninch/gigi">Green Lightning Coin (GIGI) Vault</a>
			<p>This repo is one segment of the entire project: a blockchain-based cryptocurrency network that is greener, faster, and more suitable to small transactions than leading crypto names. My contribution-- the "Vault"-- is the collection of functions required to validate transactions using Proof-of-Space methods, modeled after a much simpler implementation of Chia. Research and project are still in progress.</p></li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/jackie-mcaninch/VandyHacks-VII">Zoom Chat Monitoring App</a>
			<p>This app is intended for teachers who use Zoom for their online teaching purposes. There are a few functions it can perform: checking for chat participation, flagging inappropriate language, or searching for chats from a specific student. During this time of increased remote classwork, this can be a useful tool for teachers to obtain quick stats on their students' involvement in the Zoom classroom, through smooth interaction on a user-friendly GUI.</p></li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/jackie-mcaninch/online-grocery-store-database">Online Grocery Store Database</a>
			<p>This project uses Java and MySQL to emulate the UI for a online grocery ordering service. Included is both a customer view and employee view, each allowing the user to edit his/her information and perform actions, such as buy items or stock items. This sort of application is useful for those who may not have the ability to go to actual stores, whether that be for health concerns or general accessibility. This project aims to support online purchases by keeping track of user information and inventory of stock.</p></li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/jackie-mcaninch/Hash-Code-2021">Google Hash Code Challenge Submission</a>
			<p>This smaller project was my submission for the 2021 Google Hash Code machine learning competition. The problem to solve was to control a system of stop lights to maximize the amount of cars who could finish their given path within a certain time frame.</p></li>
