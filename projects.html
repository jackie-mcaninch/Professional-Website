		<h2>Projects</h2>
		<p>Here are some links to my favorite projects I have uploaded to Github. To see a couple more of my academic projects, visit my school affiliated Github account: <a href="https://github.com/jackie-mcaninch">jackie-mcaninch</a>. For my contributions to open-source projects, please visit my personal account: <a href="https://github.com/jaxlotl">jaxlotl</a>.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/dogecoinfoundation/libdogecoin">Libdogecoin</a>
			<p>This is a link to the Dogecoin Foundation's open-source "Libdogecoin" project, which essentially simplifies the core functionality of Dogecoin Core into one clean, portable C library that is easy for new developers to understand. Staying in close communication with Core developers, I made some significant contributions to this repository, including the high-level Python and Golang wrappers for address and transaction functionality. Additionally, I created several educational docs describing the API and other insights into cryptocurrency functions, which can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/dogecoinfoundation/libdogecoin/tree/0.1.1-dev/doc">doc</a> directory. I plan to continue working with them in the second phase of development for this library.</p></li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/jackie-mcaninch/gigi">Green Lightning Coin (GIGI)</a>
			<p>This repo is the first rough draft of our novel implementation of "Proof-of-Space" consensus. Cryptocurrency's current "Proof-of-Work" consensus algorithm require massive amounts of power to continuously generate hashes in order to mine blocks; with proof-of-space, these hashes are generated only once and reused throughout the miner's lifetime, saving a countless amount of energy. This algorithm concept allows us to build GIGI: a blockchain-based cryptocurrency network that is greener, faster, and more suitable to small transactions than leading crypto names. My contribution-- the "Vault"-- is the collection of functions required to validate transactions using Proof-of-Space methods, modeled after a much simpler implementation of Chia. Current state of the project resides <a href="https://github.com/jackie-mcaninch/gigi-x">here</a>, but contains intellectual property of Illinois Tech. Please contact me for access to the full repository.</p></li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/jackie-mcaninch/CS445-project">Buy Nothing Web RESTful API</a>
			<p>This project is to simulate the functionality of a "Buy Nothing" system, where users use the API to communicate and share items or services based on geographical location. This is a bare bones Java project which only employs simple HTTP requests inside a REST API. In the end, this project did help me learn about how to host a local web server using Apache Tomcat, as well as sending and receiving class information by JSON transport.
			<li><a href="https://github.com/jackie-mcaninch/VandyHacks-VII">Zoom Chat Monitoring App</a>
			<p>This app is intended for teachers who use Zoom for their online teaching purposes. There are a few functions it can perform: checking for chat participation, flagging inappropriate language, or searching for chats from a specific student. During this time of increased remote classwork, this can be a useful tool for teachers to obtain quick stats on their students' involvement in the Zoom classroom, through smooth interaction on a user-friendly GUI.</p></li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/jackie-mcaninch/online-grocery-store-database">Online Grocery Store Database</a>
			<p>This project uses Java and MySQL to emulate the UI for a online grocery ordering service. Included is both a customer view and employee view, each allowing the user to edit his/her information and perform actions, such as buy items or stock items. This sort of application is useful for those who may not have the ability to go to actual stores, whether that be for health concerns or general accessibility. This project aims to support online purchases by keeping track of user information and inventory of stock.</p></li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/jackie-mcaninch/430-Final-Project">NP-Hard Optimization: Separating Points by Axis-Parallel Lines</a>
			<p>This project takes a set of points as input and outputs a minimal set of horizontal and vertical lines that isolate every point in the input set. This was implemented in two ways: local optimization, where a non-minimal but feasible solution is reduced to a minimal solution, and greedy, where the solution is built from a starting point of zero lines and adds as necessary.</p></li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/jackie-mcaninch/Hash-Code-2021">Google Hash Code Challenge Submission</a>
			<p>This smaller project was my submission for the 2021 Google Hash Code machine learning competition. The problem to solve was to control a system of stop lights to maximize the amount of cars who could finish their given path within a certain time frame.</p></li>
