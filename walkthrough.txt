There are 3 pages on my website: the home page, the resume page, and the projects page. The home page gives a description of my current education level, my future career aspirations, and a declaration of my intent to work this summer, along with my headshot. I also included a paragraph on my hobbies to give a little more description of myself. Because the “about me” section is pretty long, I bolded some of the key words and information most important to employers. This page also includes a paragraph at the bottom outlining the structure of the site for clarity. The next page is the resume page, which contains both an HTML version of my resume, and also an option to download the resume as a pdf by clicking a button. Lastly, the projects page contains three links, each to a different repository on my github that contains one of my featured projects, along with short descriptions of each. My header includes my full name and contact information and is visible on every page for ease of access. The navigation tab is also tied in with the header so all three pages are visible as menu options and one is highlighted to designate which one is active.


I think if I had more time I would have liked to add one more page specifically for my hobbies and extra-curriculars, and leave the home page as basic information about me and my website. I feel like right now there is so much information on the home page that the important things will get overlooked. Another feature I thought would be interesting to add to the projects page would be small icons for each link just to give a visual aspect. I think more visuals would make the pages a lot more interesting and appealing to read.
