		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<img src="./img/headshot.PNG" alt="Headshot">
		<p>Hi, my name is Jackie and I am a 4th-Year <strong>Computer Science Major</strong> studying at <strong>Illinois Institute of Technology</strong>. I will obtain my bachelor's degree by <strong>May 2023</strong>, and I plan to earn my master's degree in <strong>Data Science</strong> by <strong>December 2023</strong>. Currently, I am looking for internships and research opportunities for the <strong>summer of 2023</strong> that can translate into a full-time position after graduation. I prefer in-person work and am willing to relocate if the position requires it.</p>
		
		<p>Regarding my career-oriented interests, some of my favorite classes in computer science so far have been Systems Programming (351), Introduction to Algorithms (430), Data-Intensive Computing (554), and Machine Learning (584). In my time researching at IIT, I've developed an interest in <strong>system resource management</strong>, <strong>algorithm efficiency</strong>, and <strong>low-level device programming</strong>. Looking forward, however, I am looking to master the application of <strong>data science</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong>, along with other use cases of big data. I've always been passionate about <strong>cryptocurrency</strong>, and my latest industry experience allowed me to get involved in the world of <strong>blockchain</strong> and <strong>open source development</strong>, which you can read more about on my <strong><a href="./projects.html">Projects</a></li></strong> page. Someday, as it is a direct threat to the encryption involved in blockchain infrastructure, I would love to delve into the field of <strong>quantum computing</strong>, something of which I find wildly intriguing to read about but don't yet have the physics background to fully understand.</p>

		<h2>Campus Involvement</h2>
		<p>I am currently <strong>vice president</strong> of ACM-W, our school's female branch of Association of Computing Machinery. It is my fourth year on the executive board and I just love being involved in the club! Some of my responsibilities nowadays include <strong>communicating</strong> to our members through mass email, <strong>training</strong> new exec members, <strong>facilitating</strong> events, and <strong>marketing</strong> to the student body. We host a variety of workshops, panels, and social events, all which benefit the women of IIT by fostering a community of <strong>professional</strong>, <strong>successful</strong>, and <strong>supportive</strong> peers. I love to stay after our workshops to have conversations with women wanting to get involved with the club, and it has been so rewarding to watch the club grow and prosper over the last few years!</p>

		<p>Another one of my favorite ways I've gotten involved at the university is through my position as a <strong>teaching assistant</strong> for our data structures and algorithms class. I find TAing to be super rewarding as I can <strong>share the knowledge</strong> I've learned with students who need it to grow in their careers as well. Preparing demos for these students has also helped me personally develop my understanding of data structures and algorithms, as well as sharpen my <strong>communication</strong> and <strong>presentation skills</strong>. Many students come to me feeling overwhelmed in the class, and I really do gain a lot of satisfaction in taking the time to help them master the topics.</p>

		<h2>Personal</h2>
		<p>In my free time, I always enjoy staying active. I've played a lot of sports in the past, including soccer, volleyball, basketball, and track. In fact, for my first three years I played for the IIT's women's competitive soccer team! Playing for IIT has taught me so much about <strong>accountability</strong>, <strong>teamwork</strong>, and <strong>work ethic</strong>, lessons I will keep with me for the rest of my life.</p>

		<p>Another big passion of mine is making <strong>music</strong>, whether it be jamming with my high school drumline, performing with mallets in concert band, or practicing classical piano on my own. I have learned a lot through my music journey as well, especially in my 15-year study of piano! I have developed keen <strong>attention to detail</strong>, objective <strong>self-discipline</strong>, and better ability to <strong>express myself</strong>.</p>

		<p>Most importantly, however, I love to spend time with my <strong>friends and family</strong>. Building relationships is something I value much more than knowledge, professional or otherwise. I know that the people I interact with have influenced me in so many ways to make me the person I am today. I hope that my own interactions with those around me inspire others like they have inspired me.</p>
