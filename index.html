		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<img src="./img/headshot.PNG" alt="Headshot">
		<p>Hi, my name is Jackie and I am a 2nd-Year <strong>Computer Science Major</strong> studying at <strong>Illinois Institute of Technology</strong>. I will obtain my bachelor's degree by 2023, and I plan to earn my master's degree in <strong>Data Science</strong> by 2024. Some of my favorite classes in computer science so far are Data Structures and Algorithms (331), Systems Programming (351), Database Organization (425), and Introduction to Algorithms (430). In the future of my career, I hope to work with <strong>algorithms for big data sets</strong>, because I love analyzing patterns and solving problems with efficient solutions. My greatest interests in this sector are applications in <strong>finance</strong>, <strong>trading</strong>, and <strong>cryptocurrencies</strong>; I am always excited to learn more about these topics! Currently, I am looking for internships and research opportunities for the <strong>summer of 2021</strong>, so that I can gain the real-world experience I need to succeed in my career later in life.</p>
		<p>In my free time, one of my hobbies is that I like to play <strong>sports</strong>. In high school, I ran track and played basketball, volleyball, and soccer. Now, I play on IIT's women's competitive soccer team! Playing for IIT has taught me so much about <strong>accountability</strong>, <strong>teamwork</strong>, and <strong>work ethic</strong>, lessons I will keep with me for the rest of my life. Another big passion of mine is making <strong>music</strong>, whether it be jamming with my high school drumline, performing with mallets in concert band, or practicing classical piano on my own. I have learned a lot through my music journey as well, especially in my 15-year study of piano: I have developed keen <strong>attention to detail</strong>, objective <strong>self-discipline</strong>, and better ability to <strong>express myself</strong>. And lastly, when I'm not in the music studio or on the soccer field, I love to spend time with my <strong>friends and my family</strong>, because <strong>building relationships</strong> is something I value even more than knowledge. These people have influenced me in so many ways to make me the person I am today, and it is my goal to have the same impact on everyone I meet.</p>
