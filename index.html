		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<img src="./img/headshot.PNG"/ alt="Headshot">
		<p>Hi, my name is Jackie and I'm a 2nd Year Computer Science Major studying at Illinois Institute of Technology. I plan to get a master's degree in Data Science by 2024. Some of my favorite things to do are play soccer, practice piano, or watch Netflix! I am looking to obtain a technical internship for the summer of 2021.</p>
