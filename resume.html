		<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
			<b>Computer science major with 6 years programming experience, skills concentrated in system resource management and efficient algorithm design. Currently seeking working opportunities for Summer 2023.</b>
		<h3>EDUCATION</h3>
			<b>Illinois Institute of Technology - GPA 3.9</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science by May 2023.</li>
				<li>Master of Science in Data Science by December 2023.</li>
			</ul>
			<b>Coursework completed:</b> Computer Organization and Architecture, Computers and Society, Database Organization, Data-Intensive Computing, Data Mining, Data Structures and Algorithms, Discrete Structures, Machine Learning, Object-Oriented Programming, Operating Systems, Software Development, Systems Programming, Technical Communication.
		<h3>EXPERIENCE</h3>
			2022
			<ul>
				<li><b>The Boring Company - Software Engineering Intern</b>
					<p>Worked in Las Vegas from January 2022 to August 2022 for Elon Musk startup under supervisor Riccardo Biasini. Contracted to work on open-sourced "Libdogecoin" cryptocurrency project (details below). Also single-handedly designed and implemented multiple custom Python services for detecting faults in the Las Vegas Loop network of Prosofts and RFID readers, crucial data-transmitting devices used in the tunnels for vehicle positioning and speed information. This was successfully used to find devices that were accidentally installed upside down, or which had radio cables that had fallen loose. Service required clear documentation for use, interpretation, and debugging.</p></li>
			</ul>
			2021
			<ul>
				<li><b>Illinois Institute of Technology - Undergraduate Teaching Assistant</b>
					<p>Worked for the school as a teaching assistant from August 2021 to present under the computer science department. Position requires engaging students in live, supplemental lab sessions for Data Structures and Algorithms, a core course for computer science majors. Sessions include dynamic and visual explanation of new concepts, simple demonstration of implementation for these concepts, and interactive Q&A. Past semesters have asked for both live presentation as well as remote, each posing their own unique challenges with communication.</p></li>

				<li><b>Illinois Institute of Technology - Undergraduate Research Assistant</b>
					<p>Worked for the school as a research assistant from August 2021 to May 2022 under Professor Ioan Raicu. Personal responsibilities included designing and implementing new data generation and storage algorithms for our project, GigiCoin, as well as communicating next steps and setbacks to the 5-person team. Together, we designed and built a testnet cluster of sixteen Raspberry Pis to demonstrate our code could be run on simple hardware.</p></li>
			</ul>
		<h3>PROJECTS</h3>
			2022
			<ul>
				<li><b>Libdogecoin: A Clean C Library for Simplified Core Dogecoin Functionality</b>
					<p>Assisted design of "Libdogecoin," an open-source C library created by the Dogecoin Foundation to condense and simplify the current Dogecoin Core protocols. The 0.1 release came out in early August and contains the functions necessary for users to generate cryptographic key pairs for use on testnet or mainnet, as well as build and sign valid transactions that can be sent to the blockchain. My main contribution was writing a high-level interface for this library by creating wrappers for the library functions in both Python and Golang, along with documentation for each of these. The purpose of this project is to help cryptocurrency beginners to climb the learning curve, enabling many more programmers to develop and improve the current state of cryptocurrency.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			2021
			<ul>
				<li><b>GigiCoin: Sustainable, High-Throughput Proof-of-Space Cryptocurrency</b>
					<p>Built a cryptocurrency valuing network-dedicated disk storage rather than demonstration of hashing power. Received first place in the 2021 Grainger Computing Innovation Prize.</p></li>
				<li><b>Campus Digital Twin: Constructing and Maintaining High Accuracy Point Clouds</b>
					<p>Collected LiDAR data and merged 50+ scans to create a 3D master point cloud of a campus building. Worked interprofessionally with architectural, civil, and mechanical engineers.</p></li>
				<li><b>NP-Hard Optimization: Separating Points by Axis-Parallel Lines</b>
					<p>Designed heuristic to determine minimum number of axis-parallel lines required to isolate all points on a given input set. Implemented both local optimization and greedy approach.</p></li>
			</ul>
			2020
			<ul>
				<li><b>Online Grocery Store Inventory Database Model</b>
					<p>Constructed interface for emulating an online goods service, using data tables to keep track of stock, suppliers, orders, and user info. Provides both employee and customer view.</p></li>
			</ul>
		<h3>COLLABORATIVE EVENTS</h3>
			2022
			<ul>
