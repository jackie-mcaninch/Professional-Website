			<b>Computer science and data science major with 6 years coding experience, skills concentrated in low-level programming and efficient algorithm design. Seeking full-time entry-level opportunities for January 2024.</b>
		<h3>EDUCATION</h3>
			<b>Illinois Institute of Technology - GPA 3.80</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science by December 2023.</li>
				<li>Master of Science in Data Science by December 2023.</li>
			</ul>
			<b>Coursework completed:</b> Computer Organization and Architecture, Computers and Society, Database Organization, Data-Intensive Computing, Data Mining, Data Preparation and Analysis, Data Structures and Algorithms, Discrete Structures, Introduction to Algorithms, Machine Learning, Object-Oriented Programming, Operating Systems, Software Engineering, Systems Programming, Technical Communication.
		<h3>EXPERIENCE</h3>
		2023
			<ul>
				<li><b>IBM - Backend Development Intern</b>
					<p>Worked in Raleigh-Durham Research Triangle Province from May 2023 to August 2023 for international corporate software provider under supervisor Sonali Konaujia. Used Python to create CLI tools for IBM's C++ developers, to enable the automation of generating necessary mock classes for product software. Additionally, analyzed several failures within security-related unit test suites and submitted fixes which solved over 50 test failures. </p>
				</li>
			</ul>	
		2022
			<ul>
				<li><b>The Boring Company - Software Engineering Intern</b>
					<p>Worked in Las Vegas from January 2022 to August 2022 for Elon Musk startup under supervisor Riccardo Biasini. Contracted to work on open-sourced "Libdogecoin" cryptocurrency project (details below). Also single-handedly designed and implemented multiple custom Python services for detecting faults in the Las Vegas Loop network of Prosofts and RFID readers, crucial data-transmitting devices used in the tunnels for vehicle positioning and speed information. This was successfully used to find devices that were accidentally installed upside down, or which had radio cables that had fallen loose. Service required clear documentation for use, interpretation, and debugging.</p></li>
			</ul>
			2021
			<ul>
				<li><b>Illinois Institute of Technology - Undergraduate Teaching Assistant</b>
					<p>Worked for the school as a teaching assistant from August 2021 to present under the computer science department. Position requires engaging students in live, supplemental lab sessions for Data Structures and Algorithms, a core course for computer science majors. Sessions include dynamic and visual explanation of new concepts, simple demonstration of implementation for these concepts, and interactive Q&A. Past semesters have asked for both live presentation as well as remote, each posing their own unique challenges with communication.</p></li>

				<li><b>Illinois Institute of Technology - Undergraduate Research Assistant</b>
					<p>Worked for the school as a research assistant from August 2021 to May 2022 under Professor Ioan Raicu. Personal responsibilities included designing and implementing new data generation and storage algorithms for our project, GigiCoin, as well as communicating next steps and setbacks to the 5-person team. Together, we designed and built a testnet cluster of sixteen Raspberry Pis to demonstrate our code could be run on simple hardware. Our finished concept and Pi-testbed won first place at the 2021 Grainger Computing Innovation Prize, for impactful research into sustainable computing. For more information on the GIGI project, visit my <a href="./projects.html">Projects</a> page.</p></li>
			</ul>
		<h3>PROJECTS</h3>
			2023
			<ul>
				<li><b>Franklin Energy Steam Project</b>
					<p>Worked on funded, cross-discipline sustainability research team for the past two years. First piece of the project deals with a battery-powered device which can be installed on a radiator valve and mechanically open and close the valve. Assisted implementation of a building-wide system of these devices which upload temperature and humidity data to central server. Lead firmware development for second piece of this project, which deals with monitoring steam traps on radiators by using the change in temperature or ultrasonic frequency readings, to detect when a steam trap has failed open. </p>

				</li>
			</ul>
			2022
			<ul>
				<li><b>Libdogecoin: A Clean C Library for Simplified Core Dogecoin Functionality</b>
					<p>Assisted design of "Libdogecoin," an open-source C library created by the Dogecoin Foundation to condense and simplify the current Dogecoin Core protocols. Wrote a high-level interface for this library in both Python and Golang, along with documentation for each of these. 
					</p>
				</li>
				<li><b>Pick-a-Flick: A Web-Based Movie Recommendation App</b>
					<p>Collaborated with a 5-man team to construct an app which generates personalized movie recommendations for users, based on machine learning analysis of their previously liked movies.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			2021
			<ul>
				<li><b>GigiCoin: Sustainable, High-Throughput Proof-of-Space Cryptocurrency</b>
					<p>Built a cryptocurrency valuing network-dedicated disk storage rather than demonstration of hashing power. Received first place in the 2021 Grainger Computing Innovation Prize.</p></li>
				<li><b>Campus Digital Twin: Constructing and Maintaining High Accuracy Point Clouds</b>
					<p>Collected LiDAR data and merged 50+ scans to create a 3D master point cloud of a campus building. Worked interprofessionally with architectural, civil, and mechanical engineers.</p></li>
				<li><b>NP-Hard Optimization: Separating Points by Axis-Parallel Lines</b>
					<p>Designed heuristic to determine minimum number of axis-parallel lines required to isolate all points on a given input set. Implemented both local optimization and greedy approach.</p></li>
			</ul>
			2020
			<ul>
				<li><b>Online Grocery Store Inventory Database Model</b>
